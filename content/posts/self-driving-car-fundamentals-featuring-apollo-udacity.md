A nice intro into how Baidu use their open-source Apollo model for their Autonomous Vehicles (Taxi). It's inevitable we're heading into a future where all vehicles, whether personal or commercial are going to become fully Autonomous. 

Aside from the Instructor clearly needing camera training, I found this course truly in-depth. I was curious to know the challenges these companies face and how it exactly it all works. The tech behind it, the algorithms used, the architectures they used, the considerations they make on a day-to-day basis and how they see it panning out in the future.
