**The Skinny**: It's 2015. And Elance just got rebranded to what is now known as [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/). But just before all that happened, some friends & I fancied ourselves cool enough to redesign and build a better mobile app for Android phones. Why not right. We called it Freelancer

We teamed up creating user journeys, user flows, user mapping, storyboarding, colour picking, typography. Using Photoshop, Illustrator.
