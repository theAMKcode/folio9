**The Challenge:** How can we help numerous clients whilst maintaining our quality of designs?

**The Solution:** Now part of [Instinctif Partners](https://instinctif.com/global/), Champollion aim was to help organisations make interesting points through media, public affairs & digital. 

I lent a hand on multiple client projects. Ranging from Web Design, Print designing for meetings, presentations & trade shows. Campaign poster creation. 

Created User Interfaces, mapped out User Experiences and designed compelling logos. Clients includes [Institute Of Fundraising](https://ciof.org.uk/), [Youth For Christ](https://resources.yfc.co.uk/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhs79BRD0ARIsAC6XpaX0NhL0CTTivVtji0VnYv5W1m3HvmbMHo1k5kQHBi083nZP4W4M3U0aAsrXEALw_wcB), [City Bridge Trust](https://www.citybridgetrust.org.uk/).
