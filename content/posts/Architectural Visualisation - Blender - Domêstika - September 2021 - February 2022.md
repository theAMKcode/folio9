September 2021 - October 2022

A year of learning an old art form. This time using Blender. Architectural Visualisation. Something I did a bit of at University years ago with my 3D Animation module. It was falling in love with something so pure and natural and just plain awesome.

It was slow. fun. interesting every day. Learnt a lot and keen for more!
