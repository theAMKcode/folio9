September 2021 - October 2022

A year of learning an old art form. This time using Blender. Architectural Visualisation using the DomÃªstika learning platform. Something I did a bit of at University years ago with my 3D Animation module. It was falling in love with something so pure and natural and just plain awesome.

It was so much fun. Terrifically slow to understand the behemoth that is Blender. Learnt a lot and keen for more!

The first render complete. Pillows didn't render properly.

Final render and very happy with how it turned out.
