Architectural Visualisation using the DomÃªstika learning platform. It was fun and slow re-learning an old art form. This time using the powerful Blender software. Having focused on Autodesk 3DS Max & Maya in my University years, during my 3D Animation module. 

It was falling in love with a practice that is so seemingly rudimentary yet builds into such wonderful result with enough patience.

The first render complete. Pillows didn't render properly.

Final render and very happy with how it turned out.
