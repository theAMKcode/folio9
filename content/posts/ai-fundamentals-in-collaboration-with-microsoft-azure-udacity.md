title: Ai Fundamentals in collaboration with Microsoft Azure - Udacity
author: Amine Mekhid

It was great to gain a deeper understanding into how Ai works in the real world. How it's many components can be implemented too. 

I found this so interesting. A little less code-focused, which made me miss coding and the problem solving aspect that comes with it. And more focused on MS Azure. The web based app version of implementing Machine Learning. 

I enjoyed the fact the course leaders took time to go over the fundamentals of AI and ML and their core concepts. This practical course helped me to see how ML engineers really do their work and what they think about on a daily basis. 

Ready for more!
