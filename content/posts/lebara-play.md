**The Challenge:** How can a Global Telecoms Giant pivot into a challenging new arena that is the entertainment industry?

**The Solution:** From Account Managers to Branding and Design, everybody helped in pooling lots of Lebara data on customers. We needed to understand the markets better. The Western European markets; also South Asia & Australia. Zooming out to understand what the channels will show, where and when helped. All of this aided in creating attractive visual content that would entice new and existing viewers to stay on the platform.
