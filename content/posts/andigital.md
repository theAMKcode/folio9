**The Challenge**: How may ANDigital's unique voice stand out from the crowd? ANDigtial focuses on accelerating digital delivery, by building better products and teams.

**The Solution**: They recruited me to design their Visual User Interfaces & Identity. Starting off with InDesigning business cards, then proceeding to their first website. User Research was key to this process. It was important to create a strong tone and style that would ring true for their future branding requirements. Both digital and print.
