Picture this. It's lockdown and I'm stuck inside like everyone else is. Instead of googling baking recipes and knitting gloves I thought to myself, "hey, I studied computer science right? well whats the next natural progression of that field?"

After barely an hour of research, I came to the conclusion that it would be Quantum Computing. After the industrial age came the computer age, I came to realise our future would be combining both technology and science. 

I found an amazing resource to give myself an intro into this world. FutureLearn. They had a free course available and I was already under way. 

The course was taught by both Rodney Van Meter & Takahiko Satoh. Easily explained and not so hard to fully grasp the concepts. I loved every minute of it.

Questions popped into my head, like how is this different to my degree and how can this scientific tech be used in companies going forward and how can we use it no just on corporate but also for the creatives out there. Did Quantum Art exist? Could you teach a Quantum Computer to solve the worlds energy and and conservation problems?
